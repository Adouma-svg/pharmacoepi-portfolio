## Overview

This portfolio demonstrates applied pharmacoepidemiology and real-world evidence (RWE) methods using **R** and **SAS** — the two dominant platforms in pharma/biotech RWE teams. All datasets are fully synthetic (no patient data) and designed to mirror the structure of real-world clinical databases (claims, EHR, registry).

Three oncology case studies cover the core methodological pillars expected in RWE/data analytics roles:

| Study | Disease | Design | Key Methods |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------|
| [1](#study-1) | Advanced NSCLC | Descriptive RWE | Table 1, treatment trends, logistic regression, forest plot |
| [2](#study-2) | Metastatic CRC | Comparative Effectiveness | KM, Cox PH, IPTW, landmark analysis, subgroup forest |
| [3](#study-3) | HR+ Breast Cancer | Drug Safety | Incidence rates, Poisson/IRR, new-user active-comparator, negative control |

## Study 1: Real-World Treatment Patterns in Advanced NSCLC {#study-1}

### Research Question
How have first-line treatment patterns shifted in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) following the introduction of immunotherapy and targeted therapies? Are there disparities in biomarker testing rates?

### Dataset
- **N = 3,000** patients with stage III–IV NSCLC (2018–2023)
- Variables: demographics, insurance, biomarker status (EGFR/ALK/PDL1), comorbidities, treatment assignment, time-to-treatment, treatment sequencing

### Methods
- **Table 1** — Standardised baseline characteristics by treatment group (`tableone`, `gtsummary`)
- **Stacked area chart** — Temporal shift in 1L treatment mix (2018–2023)
- **Alluvial/Sankey diagram** — 1L → 2L treatment sequencing (`ggalluvial`)
- **Time-to-treatment histogram** — Stratified by insurance type (access disparities)
- **Logistic regression + forest plot** — Predictors of PDL1 biomarker testing

### Key Findings (Simulated)
- Immunotherapy-based regimens increased from ~30% (2018) to ~65% (2023) of 1L treatments
- Medicaid patients had longer time-to-treatment than commercially insured patients (median 28 vs 19 days)
- Older age and squamous histology were associated with lower PDL1 testing rates

### Files
- `R/00_generate_data.R` — Reproducible synthetic data
- `R/01_analysis_treatment_patterns.R` — Full analysis pipeline
- `SAS/01_analysis_treatment_patterns.sas` — SAS equivalent (PROC FREQ, PROC LOGISTIC)

## Study 2: Comparative Effectiveness — FOLFOX vs FOLFIRI in Metastatic CRC {#study-2}

### Research Question
Does FOLFOX provide superior overall survival compared to FOLFIRI as first-line chemotherapy in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), after adjusting for confounding by indication?

### Dataset
- **N = 2,500** patients with mCRC receiving first-line chemotherapy
- Variables: demographics, ECOG status, molecular markers (KRAS/BRAF/MSI), metastasis pattern, treatment, OS/PFS outcomes

### Methods
| Method | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| Kaplan-Meier | Unadjusted OS/PFS curves with risk tables |
| Log-rank test | Unadjusted OS comparison |
| Multivariable Cox PH | Adjusted HR controlling for confounders |
| **IPTW (ATE)** | Propensity score weighting to balance treatment groups |
| Love plot / SMD | Covariate balance assessment before/after IPTW |
| Schoenfeld residuals | Proportional hazards assumption check |
| **Landmark analysis** | Avoid immortal time bias — conditioned on 12-month survival |
| Subgroup forest plot | Treatment effect heterogeneity across key subgroups |

### Why IPTW Matters Here
Treatment assignment is *not* random in RWE — sicker patients (higher ECOG, right-sided tumours) were more likely to receive FOLFIRI. Naive comparisons are biased. IPTW reweights the population to mimic randomisation, providing a more valid estimate of the average treatment effect.

### Key Findings (Simulated)
- Crude HR: FOLFOX vs FOLFIRI = 0.82 (95% CI: 0.73–0.92)
- IPTW-adjusted HR: 0.86 (95% CI: 0.77–0.96) — attenuated after confounding control
- No PH assumption violation detected; landmark analysis consistent with primary result
- Effect modification by KRAS status (stronger benefit in wild-type patients)

### Files
- `R/00_generate_and_analyze.R` — Data generation + full survival analysis
- `SAS/01_survival_analysis.sas` — PROC LIFETEST, PROC PHREG, PS weighting

## Study 3: CDK4/6 Inhibitor Cardiovascular Safety in HR+ Breast Cancer {#study-3}

### Research Question
Are CDK4/6 inhibitors (palbociclib, ribociclib, abemaciclib) associated with an elevated risk of cardiovascular events compared to endocrine monotherapy in patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer?

### Dataset
- **N = 4,000** female patients with HR+/HER2− breast cancer
- Variables: tumour stage, molecular markers, comorbidities (CVD, HTN, diabetes), CDK4/6 inhibitor identity, CV events, Grade 3+ neutropenia, UTI (negative control)

### Methods
| Method | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| Incidence rates (exact Poisson CI) | Baseline event rate quantification |
| Poisson regression (IRR) | Rate ratio adjusting for confounders |
| Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR) | Disproportionality signal detection (à la FAERS) |
| **New-user active-comparator design** | Minimise prevalent user & indication bias |
| **Negative control outcome (UTI)** | Detect unmeasured confounding / bias |
| Adverse event profile heatmap | Multi-AE multi-drug visual comparison |
| Cumulative incidence curves | Time-to-event visualisation |

### Why Negative Controls Matter
If UTI (a biologically unrelated outcome) showed a *positive* association with CDK4/6 inhibitors, it would suggest systematic confounding or data artefact. A null result for the negative control increases confidence that the CV signal is real.

### Key Findings (Simulated)
- Ribociclib showed the highest CV event rate (consistent with known QTc effects)
- Palbociclib showed Grade 3+ neutropenia rates ~3× higher than endocrine monotherapy
- UTI (negative control): IRR ~1.02 — no signal, supporting validity of study design
- In the new-user active-comparator cohort, ribociclib HR for CV events: 1.48 (1.12–1.96)

### Files
- `R/00_generate_and_analyze.R` — Data + safety analysis pipeline
- `SAS/01_drug_safety_analysis.sas` — PROC GENMOD (Poisson), PROC PHREG, PROC LIFETEST
